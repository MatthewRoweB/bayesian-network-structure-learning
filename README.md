# Bayesian Network Structure Learning Project

This repository contains research-oriented Python implementations of
Bayesian network structure learning and causal inference algorithms,
developed as part of a two-semester project course (May–December).

## Implemented Algorithms
- LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model)
- IGCI (Information-Geometric Causal Inference)
- IGSP (Interventional Greedy Sparsest Permutation)
- KCDC (Kernel-based Causal Direction Classifier)
- SLARAC (Subsampled Linear Auto-Regression Absolute Coefficients)
- BackShift 
- Adaptive Lasso 
- LB-MDL (Local Best Minimum Description Length)
- TPDA (Three-Phase Dependency Algorithm)
- Meinshausen (Meinshausen–Bühlmann Neighborhood Selection)
- IAMB (Incremental Association Markov Blanket)
- OS (Order Search)

## Work in Progress
- BQCD (Bivariate Quantile Causal Discovery) – partial implementation
- Nonlinear ANM (Nonlinear Additive Noise Model) – initial implementation

## Notes
The repository consolidates work originally developed across
multiple project folders during the course timeline.

## Usage 
Individual algorithms can be imported and run directly from their
corresponding Python modules.
